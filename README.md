# Snake
This is the classic Snake game that I coded as an assignment for my C++ lecture in college.

## Compile

    g++ main.cpp menu.cpp apple.cpp snake.cpp -o run -lncurses   

## Ncurses
It's a console game so I used the _ncurses_ library for the project. It allows me to read input from the user without the need of an **ENTER** key. There are
other features as well but I'm not going to get into details.
